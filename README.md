# ROCK PAPER SCISSOR
A game of rock paper scissors with a random computer choice.

## Reflection
A game of rock paper scissors is surprisingly simple to make. You just need lay out some conditions and it's done. The only major problem was the code being extremely bloated with unnecessary lines, so it took a while to optimize things like who won and how the computer generated a decision. 

After a few days, I came back and wanted to add an UI to this (was only playable in the console atm), so it was a bit of a challenge to transfer console based events to mouse/document events. The most challenging part was implementing a play again function where it would add a button after the game was over and restart the game. It made my head explode after it kept adding button after button, so I had to scavenge everywhere trying to make it only happen once. Then once I changed that, something else didn't want to work and the spiral went on for longer than expected.
